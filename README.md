Assignment Instructions

The first goal of this assignment is to read the tree structure from a file and display the tree structure on the console as described next. Each line in the file will hold a node's ID and its children's IDs. For example, if the file contains the following:  

1 2 3 4  
3 6  
4 7 8  

The first ID in each line represents the parent node and the remaining IDs in that line are its children. In the tree structure above, 1 has three children 2,3,4; node 3's child is 6, and 7 and 8 are children of node 4. Node 2 does not have any child and that's why it is not at the start of any line in the file. Node 1 is the root of the tree always and it will be in the first column of the first line in the file.  

Your first goal is to read the data from a file that you can assume will be stored in Dr. Dutta's computer. The file name will be "tree.txt". DO NOT use any specific file address location in the code. Once you read the file, the next goal would be to print the tree structure on the console in the following ways:  

• Pre-order traversal  
• Post-order traversal  
• In-order traversal (if the tree is binary)  
• BFS  

• You can have multiple classes, but they ALL HAVE TO BE in a SINGLE JAVA FILE.  
• The filename will be "assign3.java"  
• Submit "assign3.java" FILE ONLY.
